As the sample size increases,&&The Population mean decreases&&The population standard deviation decreases&&The standard deviation for the distribution of the sample means increases&&The standard deviation for the distribution of sample means decreases&&The Population mean decreases&&
Samples of size 49 are drawn from a population with a mean of 36 and a standard deviation of 15. Then P(x < 33) is _________&&0.5808&&0.4192&&0.1608&&0.0808&&0.4192&&
The sampling distribution is approximately the t-distribution with degrees of freedom&&n&&n-1&&n-2&&2n-1&&n-1&&
